If you make changes to a file like `index.jsx` in your React app, here's the step-by-step process to ensure your changes are deployed to GitHub Pages:

### **1. Edit Your Code**
- Make the changes you need in `index.jsx` or any other source file in the `src` directory.

### **2. Test Your Changes Locally**
- Start the development server to see the changes live:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Visit the local development server, usually at `http://localhost:5173`, and ensure everything works as expected.

### **3. Build the Updated Project**
- Once you're satisfied with the changes, generate the updated production build:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
  This will update the contents of the `dist` folder with the new version of your app.

### **4. Deploy to GitHub Pages**
- Deploy the updated `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy
  ```
  This will overwrite the old deployment with your updated app.

### **5. Verify the Deployment**
- Visit your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/`) and check if the changes are live.
- If you donâ€™t see the updates, clear your browser cache or force refresh (`Ctrl + F5` or `Cmd + Shift + R`).

### **6. Commit Your Source Code Changes**
- Even though your deployed site is updated, don't forget to commit your source code changes to your main branch for version control:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Update index.jsx with <describe changes>"
  git push origin main
  ```

### **Quick Summary**
1. **Edit your files**: Make changes in `src/index.jsx`.
2. **Test locally**: Run `npm run dev`.
3. **Build the project**: Run `npm run build`.
4. **Deploy**: Run `npm run deploy`.
5. **Commit your changes**: Save your source code with `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
